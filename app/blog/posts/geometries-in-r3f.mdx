## What is React Three Fiber?

React Three Fiber (R3F) is a React renderer for Three.js. It lets you create 3D objects, animations, and scenes inside a React app, blending Reactâ€™s component-based architecture with Three.jsâ€™s 3D capabilities.

## Understanding Geometries in R3F

In R3F, **geometries** define the shape of 3D objects. You can use basic predefined geometries like **BoxGeometry**, **SphereGeometry**, and **TorusGeometry**. These geometries are then added to your scene to create 3D visuals.

---

## Basic Geometries

Letâ€™s explore some basic geometries you can work with in R3F:

### Box Geometry

A simple box, defined by width, height, and depth:

```
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { BoxGeometry, MeshBasicMaterial, Mesh } from 'three';

const Box = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```

This creates a 1x1x1 blue box in 3D space.

---

### Sphere Geometry

A sphere, defined by its radius and width/height segments:

```
const Sphere = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh>
        <sphereGeometry args={[1, 32, 32]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="red" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```

This creates a red sphere with a radius of 1 and 32 segments.

---

### Torus Geometry

A torus (donut shape), defined by radius and tube size:

```
const Torus = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh>
        <torusGeometry args={[1, 0.4, 16, 100]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="green" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```

This creates a green torus with a radius of 1 and tube thickness of 0.4.

---

## Transforming Geometries

You can easily transform geometries by changing their position, rotation, or scale. For example, to rotate the **BoxGeometry**:

```
const RotatingBox = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh rotation={[Math.PI / 4, Math.PI / 4, 0]}>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```

This will rotate the box by 45 degrees on the X and Y axes.

## Conclusion

R3F simplifies the process of creating and transforming 3D objects in React applications. By understanding basic geometries like **Box**, **Sphere**, and **Torus**, you can start building complex 3D scenes with ease. Experiment with different geometries and transformations to bring your 3D creations to life!
